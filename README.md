# Enhanced-YOLOv5-for-weld-flaws-localization-
Developing YOLOv5 for weld flaws detection and localization in gamma radiography images based on attention mechanisms.
After image preprocessing,
1- You can use the official YOLOv5 from https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5
2- Just replace the common.py and yolo.py in the models folder.
3- Use WeldFlaws_data.yaml for data description and location. 
4- Use the proposed model in yolov5_SK_Bot.yaml.
5- Use WeldFlaws_data.yaml and yolov5_SK_Bot.yaml in train.py.
